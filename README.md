# Warhorse64
This repo is my stab at adding a custom mechanical keyboard to the universe.  I 
started off with some inspiration from the Atreus62, tweaked the layout for my 
hobbit hands, and now it's an awesome prototype with an Oled, and encoder, and 
soon a feedback device, most likely a solenoid.  

# Controller
Currently a Teensy 4.1 running CircuitPython with KMK mechanical keyboard 
firmware.  So far I am loving the kmk stuff, and it's working a treat.
